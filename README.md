# What's Chrysalis?
Chrysalis is a general purpose, completely free and open source, MLP-themed Discord bot. I made this bot because I'm sick of proprietary bots that charge you for half of their features, and you probably are too.

# How to build

###### Chrysalis is made with discord.js v13.6, so you will need Node.js 16.9 or higher to run it.

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Install MongoDB in your server.
4. Make a copy of `.env_sample`, put your database details and your Discord token in it and rename it to `.env`.
5. Start the bot using `npm run dev` (for development) or `npm start` (for production).
